- 2021-10-24 17:00, Worked for 1 hour and 5 minutes
  - I have written my first code, began with the title of the quiz, Changed background color and text color. Changed the position of the text. I did this with help of tips from different sites. Learned a little bit of CSS today aswell.

- 2021-10-31 00:36, Worked for 1 hour and 15 minutes
  - I have created a start button that is inside a box. Changed color on both text and background and changed the font aswell. I changed the position so the button is aligned with the title. Tried researching on how to make the button start the quiz. 

- 2021-10-31 15:05, Worked for 2 hours and 5 minutes
  - I have created a link for the button so the user can start the quiz. Right now the link just transfer the user to an empty page. Next thing is to start working on the questions. The text is still a little weird when the window is resized and I haven't found a way to fix it. Yet.

- 2021-10-31 19:30, Worked for 40 minutes
  - Got some help from my boyfriend to figure out why the text is jumping down. Research and founded a fix for it and now it works. 

- 2021-11-08 16:00, Worked for 2 hours and 30 minutes
  - Finally I figured it out and could finally progress. Found a tutorial that I could follow and used the information from the lesson today. I learned some new things aswell and now I can begin to add the rest of the questions, because I have now just done 2 questions. 

- 2021-11-13 21:20, Worked for around 2 hours
 - I did some CSS to make the quiz look nicer. Gonna add the other questions soon. Want to make an restart button first.

 - 2021-11-15, Worked for 1 hour
 - At the lesson i worked with the restart button and got some help making it work as expected. Then after that I did some CSS to make it look better.

 - 2021-11-25, Worked for 40 minutes
 - I coded in the rest of the questions with the answer + the right answer. Tested the quiz a few times and it works as expected. 

- 2021-11-27, Worked for 1 hour
- I changed some of the objects to variables and changed the prototypes into functions. For some reason I couldn't change one prototype into a function.

- 2021-12-02, Worked for 1 hour
- Have changed every prototype and object to a variable, function and 2d arrays. Now I just need to make the check answers function check if one answer is correct and the others wrong. Because now every choice I click is the correct one when I try the quiz. I get 10 out of 10 every time.

- 2021-12-09, Worked for 1 hour and 30 minutes
- After the help from Colin I could finally make the check for answer function work as expected. I just had one tiny detail off and now it works. I then removed all the comments with unnecessary code and comments that wasn't for any use anymore. After that I wrote some comment on every part of the code to make me understand the code in the future.

- 2021-12-13, Worked for 1 hour and 20 minutes
- Have been experimenting with a progress bar and haven't made any great progress. Have saved what I have done in comments and gonna return to look at it again. Not sure if I can figure this one out. 

-2021-12-14/15, Worked for 2 hours
- I have made the progress bar work! With some experimenting and looking around on Google I got the help I needed to make it work as expected.

- 2021-12-17/18, Worked for 2 hours and 30 minutes
- Have written the project summary and commit it on GitHub. Have jumped into my quiz, checked that everything worked. Changed a console.log into a comment (to save for the future). Then I changed the game over text to "Congratulations!
You have finished the quiz".

- 2021-12-19, Worked for 1 hour and 40 minutes
- Tested the quiz again to make sure everything is woring as expected and I have written the user guide on GitHub.

- 2021-12-20, Worked for 40 minutes
- I tested to send my quiz to my boyfriend because I wanted him to see and test the quiz. But when he pressed start it said that it couldn't find the file for my actual quiz. I earlier linked my quiz file to the start screen button but if the file isn't in the persons computer it can't be found. So adding this to the bug-list, summary and updating my code to Github.
