# Project Notes

Project Instructions: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

> You can use this section of the file to keep notes about your project as you work on it.

> I have now set up everything, all i need to do is to start code the program. I feel like this program is gonna be too hard for me to do, because there is different types of language you need to use. Language I haven't used.

> Now when I have finally understand that we have learned the code i'm gonna use (face palm), thanks to Colin. I'm gonna learn CSS though but with the help of different websites I think it will be ok. I have done the beginning of my code now and it works really good. Some videos I have noticed been outdated because it didn't work when I was experimenting with my code. But now I have found a code that works.

> I have a hard time figuring out how to make the start button work. I haven't started coding the questions and maybe that is the problem. I'm gonna research some more and experiment, if I can't make it work I'm gonna ask Colin for help. 

> I have finally found a way to make the start button work as expected. I'm now moving forward to the actual quiz.

> After many days, hours and nights I have finally progressed with the actual quiz. I have followed a tutorial that did exactly what I was looking for. Some things i'm gonna change because I don't want it to look exactly like that and it would be copying. Now I can begin to store all the questions and look at maybe adding some functions. Maybe a restart button?

> Made some more CSS to the actual quiz. Began to look at a restart button but can't figure out how to make it work. Will write in the questions when i have created the restart button. 

> Got help at the lesson today to make a restart button. Made it work and added some CSS to make it look good. Want to try make a progress bar instead of a progress that just says "Question x out of y". But first i'm gonna write in the rest of my questions and then make some final touches to the quiz.
