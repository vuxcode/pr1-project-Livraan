# Project Notes

> I have now set up everything, all i need to do is to start code the program. I feel like this program is gonna be too hard for me to do, because there is different types of language you need to use. Language I haven't used.

> Now when I have finally understand that we have learned the code i'm gonna use (face palm), thanks to Colin. I'm gonna learn CSS though but with the help of different websites I think it will be ok. I have done the beginning of my code now and it works really good. Some videos I have noticed been outdated because it didn't work when I was experimenting with my code. But now I have found a code that works.

> I have a hard time figuring out how to make the start button work. I haven't started coding the questions and maybe that is the problem. I'm gonna research some more and experiment, if I can't make it work I'm gonna ask Colin for help. 

> I have finally found a way to make the start button work as expected. I'm now moving forward to the actual quiz.

> After many days, hours and nights I have finally progressed with the actual quiz. I have followed a tutorial that did exactly what I was looking for. Some things i'm gonna change because I don't want it to look exactly like that and it would be copying. Now I can begin to store all the questions and look at maybe adding some functions. Maybe a restart button?

> Made some more CSS to the actual quiz. Began to look at a restart button but can't figure out how to make it work. Will write in the questions when i have created the restart button. 

> Got help at the lesson today to make a restart button. Made it work and added some CSS to make it look good. Want to try make a progress bar instead of a progress that just says "Question x out of y". But first i'm gonna write in the rest of my questions and then make some final touches to the quiz.

> Now I have written in all the questions with the answers and the right answer to each question. The remaining time I have left will be used in making small changes in CSS and maybe experiment with the progress text to be a progress bar instead. Then after that is to start write the summary and the text for the quiz. 

> Have began changing the objects and prototypes into variables and functions. Tested and it worked until one of the prototype couldn't be a function. Going to look into it. 

> After getting some help from Colin I have made great progress on my quiz. All the objects and prototypes are replaced. One thing need fixing and that is the check answer function. After that I can focus on the progress bar and eventually the result list.

> I finally got the help to fix my previous problem. It was just one tiny detail that was wrong and I got an "aha" moment. Now the quiz works as expected. I then removed the unnecessary comments with the obejcts and prototypes that was left. Then made some new comments to every step in the code so I can understand it easier. 
> 
> What's left on the list are:
>
> * Creating a progress bar instead of "progress text"
> 
> * Creating a result page where every question is displayed. If the user answered wrong on one question the text of that question are red, if the user answered right the text of that question will be green. The answers will not be displayed.

> The progress bar was more difficult than I thought. It seems that I can't make it work with my other code. Will try some more and if I can't I will skip that for now and try to focus on the result list.

> I'm so happy! I got the progress bar to work as I wanted. One thing I had done wrong was spelling "element" wrong and that's why I got an error on console log. Now that is sorted I will move over to the result list. If I can't make it work I will jump over that one.

> Now I have done some last checks on the program and written the Project Summary and the User Guide. Have loaded everything I have done and written the comments in my code. Unfortunately I don't have the time to create a result page, but I still have the comments for storing the answers. So that I can use them in the future, if I want to try to figure out how to make the result page.

> Of course at the last minute a problem came. I tried to send my quiz to my boyfriend and of course he couldn't start it. Because he didn't have the code for the actual quiz when I sent only the code for the startscreen. What I need to do now is to add the startscreen into the rest of the code. Have tried on my own but can't make it work.

> With the help from Colin I could see how I could do it in an easy way. I copied the code for the start screen and pasted it into the quiz code. After that I changed some tiny details that didn't work now because some in CSS got doubled. Then I needed to hide the questions and the start screen, do a function that's either displays the start screen and hides the quiz or hides the start screen and displays the quiz. After that it worked! We tried to experiment on the result page but we couldn't finish it because we didn't know how to do the last part. I sat down and tried my own idea how to do it. Came somewhere but it's not finished because I cant figure it out. But turned everything into comments for future use or experiments.

# Project Summary
 
> In the beginning I thought that my idea shouldn't be too difficult to develop, but over time I realized that it was much more difficult than I planned. The first I tried to do was researching some code in W3 School. When I did the start page for my quiz I learned a new code language, CSS. It makes my program look better and I can change how everything looks. That was easy, after that I made a button that was gonna start the quiz. Then next problem came, I didn't know how to make a button to direct to my code for the quiz. After some hours of looking through videos and google searching I found a solution, I created a new file where my quiz code was gonna be. Then I linked that file in the button and it worked. 
>
> When I have worked for a while with my start page I went to the next step: the actual quiz. I tried on my own first and looked through the lesson notes, I couldn't make it work at all, then I tried searching how to make a quiz in simple code. Every video I saw was to complicated so I read through others code and experimented if that code work. But nothing was what I wanted in my code. I worked night and day, barely got any sleep and had all the code stuck in my head. I couldn't walk away from the computer because I wanted to experiment with some ideas I got. Nothing still worked and tried getting help from my teacher. I tried some of the tips and looked a little more for tips on how to make it work. After a while of searching and opening links I finally found a person who had created a code that made the program do exactly what I wanted. I wrote down the code and it worked, I was so relieved that it was working. When I showed the code to my teacher he gave some good input, I have done a code that was to advanced for the course and I technically copied the whole Javascript code. Because of that me and my teacher went through the code and I got some help understanding the code and how I could change it to something that I have learned on the course. 
>
> First I changed all the objects into variables, after that I changed the prototypes into functions and some of the prototypes gave some errors when I changed them into funtions. I then got some help see that the prototype needs to change before I could turn it into a function. After some experimenting and testing the function worked. I then deleted the old code that have been replaced because I had turned them into comments so they where still in the code if something was wrong in the code. When that was sorted I had a meeting with my teacher and went through the more difficult parts that I couldn't understand. After some instructions on how to think from my teacher it clicked and I could finish the last replacement of the code. In one lesson where we went through each others problems I got some help creating a restart button because I couldn't make the button only show up at the end of the quiz. Learned a little bit about "append child" and I could make the restart button work, it worked that the button refreshed the site and it automatically restarts the quiz. 
>
> I had some problem making the program go through all the choices and pick up the one that was correct. I stored the question in one 2D array and the answers in another 2D array. A for-loop will then go through the answers and pick out the right one. The problem was that I couldn't link the right choice to the question, after some work with help of my teacher I made it work in a function with an if-statment and else-statement. Then after that I wanted to change the progress into a progress bar, instead of a text saying "y out of x" I wanted a bar that filled up after each click on the button and in the bar it would say "y/x". This took a little while because I needed to make the code I found go in and work with my code. After some work with it I could get it to work as expected. Made some CSS and got the function to write the current question and the number of total questions. 
>
> But then at the last day until deadline I got antoher problem. I wanted my boyfriend to try my quiz, but when I sent the start file for the program it couldn't find the actual quiz. Because the startscreen isn't connected properly to the rest of the code. I tried and tried to figure it out on my own, but nothing worked for some reason. So I again needed some pushing into the right direction. When I and Colin sat down and went through everything it wasn't that hard to see what I needed to do. I could just copy and paste the whole start screen code and delete some code that got doubled. Made some new functions that just controled when a button is clicked it's eihter hides the start screen and displays the questions or shows the start screen and hides the questions. Got some idea how to create the result page but isn't there yet to say it's finished, so I made those to comments for future experiment.  
>
> After this time with the project I have learned how to code in different ways and see how it works. In the lesson notes I could get an idea on how it works, though I needed some help to get that code to work in other ways than what it says in the notes. The lesson notes could have had some more challenges, example that there is a code that is not finished and you need to make it work with what you learned on that lesson, then show it to the teacher. In that way the teacher also sees how much the person is learning and understands, if someone don't understands it they could get a repetition on that lesson or the whole class gets an repetition. 
>
> I'm happy that I chose to do a quiz because I learned a lot more and it really worked for me to take an advanced code and replace it with the type of code I have learned. What I have hoped to make before the projects deadline was to make the users choices stored and then they could click on a result button that gets the user to a page that had all the questions lined up in columns. If the user had answered right the questions text would be green, if the user answered wrong the text would be red. I have the beginning of that code ready but I can't get to the next part, to make a function that opens up a new page and shows the result. I didn't want the user to know the answers and just show what question the user had answered right. 
>
>There was also some other things I had wanted to do: 
>* Have the questions come up in an random order
>* Have the choices come in an random order on the buttons
>* Have a timer
>* Have different degrees of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme) - Where the questions would be different for each difficulty
>* Create a wall that makes it impossible to see the answers and questions in console log
>* Give user lives that the user loses if the answer was wrong, if all lives is out the user needs to begin all over again
>* Have more questions
>
>At last, this have been a fun course to be in, the teacher was funny and easy to talk to and I learned a lot. This knowledge will help me in future work and my further studies. 
>
>Thanks Colin for this amazing time!

> P.s: Colin, Don't forget to close all the active programs and pages so you computer lives longer.

# User Guide

> First the player gets a start screen where the quiz name "The Gaming Quiz" is in a big text, under that the player has the start button. When the player hovers over the button lights up, when clicking on it the first question comes up. This game is a 10 question quiz where the player gets four different choices to chose from, also the game doesn't progress until the player have answered. The theme of the quiz is about different games or things surrounding gaming. Some of the answers can be misleading and the player needs to think before answering. 
>
> The four choices are in form of four buttons the player clicks on, when the player hovers over each button they lights up as the start button does. In that way the player sees what button they hover over, so they don't mistakenly clicks on a button they didn't meant to click on. There are only one correct answer for each question. When a player clicks on one of the buttons the player will not get any confirmation that the player answered right or wrong. The player also sees a progress bar so they can see how much they progressed through the quiz, every time the player answers the bar fills up little by little. 
>
> After the player has answered all 10 questions they get an end game page. Here the player gets a message: "Congratulations, you have finished the quiz!" and under that text the player sees how many questions they answered right in form of points, example: "5/10". At last the player has one button on the end game page, the restart button. The player can therefore restart the quiz and test the questions again. 
>
> Hope you enjoy the quiz!
